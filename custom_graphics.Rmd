## Summary

Communicating is one of the most important steps in the data science process. Efforts might go unnoticed if you can't clearly and attractively communicate ideas.

Data in this report is concerned with the internatinal labor market.


## Preparations

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(forcats)
```


```{r raw data maniuplation}
# load in data frames by double clicking them as they are already in .Rdata format or use this function
load("ilo_hourly_compensation.RData") 
load("ilo_working_hours.RData") 

glimpse(ilo_hourly_compensation)
glimpse(ilo_working_hours)

# Join both data frames
ilo_data <- ilo_hourly_compensation %>%
  inner_join(ilo_working_hours, by = c("country", "year"))

# Count the resulting rows
ilo_data  %>% 
    count()

# Examine ilo_data
ilo_data
```

For displaying data in ggplot2 graphics, it is often helpful to convert all the variables to the right data type. Usually, **categorical variables like country in this example should be converted to factors before plotting them.** You can do so using as.factor(). In your data set, two columns are still of type "character" â€“ use mutate() to turn them into factors.

```{r}
# Turn year and country into a factor
ilo_data_corrected <- ilo_data %>%
  mutate(year = as.factor(as.numeric(year)),
        country = as.factor(country))

# Examine the European countries vector
european_countries <- c("Finland",        "France",         "Italy",          "Norway",       
"Spain",          "Sweden",         "Switzerland",    "United Kingdom",
"Belgium",        "Ireland",        "Luxembourg",     "Portugal",      
"Netherlands",    "Germany",        "Hungary",       "Austria",       
"Czech Rep.")

# Only retain European countries
ilo_data <- ilo_data_corrected %>%
  filter(country %in% european_countries)

# Examine the structure of ilo_data
str(ilo_data)

# Group and summarize the data
ilo_data %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(mean_hourly_compensation = mean(hourly_compensation),
            mean_working_hours = mean(working_hours))

# Examine the structure of ilo_data
str(ilo_data)

# Group and summarize the data
ilo_data %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(mean_hourly_compensation = mean(hourly_compensation),
            mean_working_hours = mean(working_hours))

# Filter for 2006
plot_data <- ilo_data %>%
  filter(year == 2006)
  
  str(plot_data)
  
# Save plot into a variable
ilo_plot <- ggplot(plot_data) +
  geom_point(aes(x = working_hours, y = hourly_compensation)) +
  labs(
    x = "Working hours per week",
    y = "Hourly compensation",
    title = "The more people work, the less compensation they seem to receive",
    subtitle = "Working hours and hourly compensation in European countries, 2006",
    caption = "Data source: ILO, 2017"
  )

# # Try out theme_minimal
# ilo_plot +
#   theme_minimal()
# 
# # Try out any other possible theme function
# ilo_plot +
#   theme_classic()
#   )

# check out ?element_text()

ilo_plot <- ilo_plot +
  theme_minimal() +
    theme(
    text = element_text(family = "serif"),
    title = element_text(color = "gray25"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),
    plot.caption = element_text(color = "gray30"))

ilo_plot <- ilo_plot +
  # "theme" calls can be stacked upon each other, so this is already the third call of "theme"
  theme(
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray95"),
    plot.margin = unit(c(5, 10, 5, 10), units = "mm")
  )


# Render the plot object
ilo_plot
```


ggplot2 themes
 
 theme(
    text = element_text(
      family = "Bookman",
      color = "gray25")


You can also define your own custom plot
```{r}
theme_green <- function(){
  theme(
    plot.background = 
      element_rect(fill = "green"),
    panel.background = 
      element_rect(fill = 
        "lightgreen")
  )
}

ggplot(ilo_data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(
  x = working_hours)) +
  labs(x = "Working hours per week",
       y = "Number of countries") +
theme_green()
```

**Facetting**
There are some specific theme backgrounds for facetted plots
strip.background
strip.text

```{r}
ilo_data <- ilo_data %>%
  filter(year == "1996" | 
  year == "2006")

#postition horizontally
ggplot(ilo_data) +
  geom_histogram(aes(
    x = working_hours)) +
  labs(
    x = "Working hours per week",
    y = "Hourly compensation",
    title = "The more people work, the less compensation they seem to receive",
    subtitle = "Working hours and hourly compensation in European countries, 2006",
    caption = "Data source: ILO, 2017"
  ) +
  facet_grid(. ~ year)

# for vertical (year as the row) use this
# facet_grid(year ~ .)
# like this: (row ~ column)
# you specify if you want the variable in the row of column of the chart
```

```{r}
# Define your own theme function 
theme_ilo <- function() {
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(
    text = element_text(family = "serif", color = "gray25"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),
    plot.caption = element_text(color = "gray30"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray95"),
    plot.margin = unit(c(5, 10, 5, 10), units = "mm")
  )
}

ilo_plot <- ilo_plot +
  theme_ilo()

# Examine ilo_plot
ilo_plot

ilo_plot +
  # Add another theme call
  theme(
    # Change the background fill and color
    strip.background = element_rect(fill = "gray60", color = "gray95"),
    # Change the color of the text
    strip.text = element_text(color = "white")
  )

# The above theme call changes the titles for the facetted charts, adds gray boxes, and turns the color of the text white. Looks good!


```

### **Using geom_path()** to create dotplots
geom_path() connects the observations in the order in which they appear in the data. This type of chart is useful in showing change over time. Many publications use this type of chart. 

![From the New York Times](nytimesgraphic.png)
ggplot() +
    geom_path(aes(x = numeric_variable, y = factor_variable),
                arrow = arrow(___))

It is clear that all european countires have seen a decrease in working hours. What a life! 
```{r}
ggplot(ilo_data) +
  geom_path(aes(x = working_hours, y = country),
  # Add an arrow to each path
            arrow = arrow(length = unit(1.5, "mm"), type = "closed"))
```

The order of factor levels determine the order of appearance in ggplot2.
Reordering factors with the forcats package
Needs to be loaded with library(forcats)
fct_drop for dropping levels
fct_rev for reversing factor levels
fct_reorder for reordering them.

```{r}
library(forcats)

# Reorder country factor levels
ilo_data <- ilo_data %>%
  # Arrange data frame
  arrange(year) %>%
  # Reorder countries by working hours in 2006
  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country,
                               working_hours,
                               last)) # orders the factor, country, by the last value of working_hours (can also use mean, median, etc)

# Save plot into an object for reuse
ilo_dot_plot <- ggplot(ilo_data) +
  geom_path(aes(x = working_hours, y = country),
            arrow = arrow(length = unit(1.5, "mm"), type = "closed")) +
    # Specify the hjust aesthetic with a conditional value
    geom_text(
          aes(x = working_hours,
              y = country,
              label = round(working_hours, 1),
              hjust = ifelse(year == "2006", 1.4, -.4)
            ),
          # Change the appearance of the text
          size = 3,
          family = "serif",
          color = "gray25"
          )

ilo_dot_plot

# Reuse ilo_dot_plot
ilo_dot_plot <- ilo_dot_plot +
  # Add labels to the plot
  labs(
    x = "Working hours per week",
    y = "Country",
    title = "People work less in 2006 compared to 1996",
    subtitle = "Working hours in European countries, development since 1996",
    caption = "Data source: ILO, 2017"
  ) +
  # Apply your theme
  theme_ilo() +
  # theme_wsj() +
  # theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  # theme_economist() +
  # theme_economist_white() +
  # theme_stata() +

The R package ggthemes provides another gallery of custom ggplot themes, which include:

theme_tufte(): a minimalist theme
theme_economist(): theme based on the plots in the economist magazine
theme_economist_white() +
theme_stata(): theme based on stata graph schemes.
theme_hc(): theme based on Highcharts JS
theme_wsj() +
theme_fivethirtyeight() +


Key R functions for economist:

theme_economist()
scale_fill_economist()
scale_color_economist()

```{r mobile device optimization}
# Compute temporary data set for optimal label placement
median_working_hours <- ilo_data %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(median_working_hours_per_country = median(working_hours)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Have a look at the structure of this data set
str(median_working_hours)

ilo_dot_plot +
  # Add label for country
  geom_text(data = median_working_hours,
            aes(y = country,
                x = median_working_hours_per_country,
                label = country),
            vjust = 1.8,
            # hjust = 0,
            family = "serif",
            color = "gray25",
            size = 2.5) +
  # Remove axes and grids
  theme(
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    # Also, let's reduce the font size of the subtitle
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 9)
  )
```
